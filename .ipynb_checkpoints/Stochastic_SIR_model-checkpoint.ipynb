    "- Recovered (R): people who have recovered from the disease\n",

    "It is only possible to move from S to I and from I to S. Here we will assume that a person who has recovered is immune and cannot get the disease anymore.\n",

    "\n",
    "A simulation of a SIR process can be achieved using the Gillespie algorithm. When applied to this model, the Gillespie algorithm runs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each person, find the rate of change of their state, then calculate the **total rate of change** as the sum of the rates of all people. If a person is infected, their rate of change is $\\gamma$, if instead they are susceptible, their rate of change is $m\\cdot\\beta$, where $m$ is the number of infected people they are in contact with.\n",
    "2. Find the **time** when the **next event** (infection or recovery) will occur. This is done by extracting the time from an exponential distribution with rate equal to the total rate of change.\n",
    "3. Select **which event occurs**, according to the probability of each event's rate. This process can be divided into two parts <br>\n",
    "    - *Determine if the event is a recovery or an infection*: The total rate $R$ can be written as the sum of the total infection rate $R_{inf}$ and total recovery rate $R_{rec}$. Therefore, for this step we extract a random number between 0 and $R$, if it's lower than $R_{rec}$, a recovery occurs, if it's higher an infection occurs.<br>\n",
    "    - *Determine which node gets recovered/infected*: If the event is a recovery, since the recovery rate is $\\gamma$ for all infected people, we randomly choose one of them. Instead, if event is an infection, we need to consider that some suscecptible nodes have an infection rate higher than others because they have more infected neighbors. For this reason, we track the maximum infection rate $r_{max}$ and take the ratio of the rate of a randomly extracted person $r_n$ and $r_{max}$. We extract another random number $p$ between 0 and 1 and if $p<r_n/r_{max}$, $n$ gets infected, otherwise we extract another person $n'$ and repeat the process.\n",
    "4. **Update the rates** according to which person has changed their state and repeat the process.\n",

    "These results help understand how a change in $R_0$ can help the National Health System during the spread of a disease.\n",
    "It is interesting that even if $R_0 = 0.5$, most of the times all the population gets infected. With $R_0 = 0.2$ there is instead a big spread in the results, ranging from 0% to more than 90% of the population (Figure 4), but also in this case there is an almost 50% chance that more than 80% of the population gets infected.  <br>\n",
    "However, what changes drastically with $R_0$ is the maximum number of infected people in a given day (Figure 4). If $R_0 = 2$, in the day where the number of infected is maximum, between 70 and 90% of the population is expected to be infected. This can be a big problem for the National Health System, which might not be able to keep up with such a high healthcare request. Instead,as $R_0$ decreases this percentage gets lower, for example in the case of $R_0 = 0.2$, this drops between 1 and 40%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, with a lower $R_0$, there is still a high chance that the whole population gets infected, but in a longer time, so that the Health System is able to cure everyone during the epidemic. This is demonstrated in Figure 5, which represents the curves of the number of infected people as a function of time for $R_0 = 2$ and $R_0 = 0.5$. The curve with lower $R_0$ is more spread out and has a lower maximum value"
